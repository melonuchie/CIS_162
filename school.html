<h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>Going back to college has been great experience for me, and it has been truly enjoyable. One advantage about returning back to college later in life is that it does have a great sense of purpose and are more focused in my studies. At this point in my life, I am content with where I am now however, I know there is more out there. I'm a big fan of puzzles and I thrive for a good challenge which has lead me to computer programming. <a href="https://www.cerritos.edu/cis/default.htm">Cerritos College</a> has a great computer and Information Science department. Excited to see where this new journey leads me to.</p>
